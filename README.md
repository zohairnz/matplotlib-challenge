Module 5 Challenge

In this challenge, I analyzed pharmaceutical data for anti-cancer medications. I was given access to a recent animal study in which 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

In analyzing the data, I created bar charts, pie charts, box and whisker plots, and scatter plots. For the box and whisker plots, I determined statistical values such as IQR. For the scatter plot, I fit the data with a regression line.
